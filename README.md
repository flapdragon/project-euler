# Project Euler

Working through [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problem set. I am grateful to [Mr. Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler) :mage: for maintaining this website for over 300 years now and I'm sure he's probably more than a little tired.

I do not know the math so almost always my first approach it to iterate, because I am full monke programmer.

Once I have my humble approach, only then do I look at the description and solution from Project Euler. When I implement the Euler solution there is always a flabbergasting performance improvement as I squint at the math and my function struggles to finish.

I take it as an opportunity to learn the math behind the answer. Sometimes this takes considerably longer for me than learning a programming concept but I hope to find more and more uses for the math in my personal and professional programming.
